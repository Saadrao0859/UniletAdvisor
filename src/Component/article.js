        <p>
            Welcome to a series; one which could be endless due to the sheer
            amount of horror experienced by students across the UK when it comes
            to student renting.
          </p>
          <p>
            As students our innocence goes awfully deep. We are easy targets,
            wrongly seen as fools who will chuck our student loan at anything
            that says ‘bills included’. This makes us appear easy to manipulate
            and therefore we often wind up being mugged off when it comes to
            renting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we’re sometimes greeted with crusty rooms, suspicious
            stains and rickety furniture. Not to mention the overgrown gardens…
          </p>
          <p>
            There is something about being young and inexperienced that makes
            landlords and letting agents think we enjoy living in squalor. As
            though we won’t raise complaints as we are easy-going and placid. As
            if we thrive when living with rodents. That, as we grow into adults,
            bedroom ceiling(s).
          </p>
          <p>
            This series is dedicated to and in justice for the unsung
            inhabitants and their wretched experiences. From vermin
            infestations, cowboy landlords and unstable, mould-covered ceilings.
            These unlucky folks have seen, felt and heard it all… The first
            victims we hear from attend the University of Sunderland.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a house of seven, these students were still outnumbered by mice.
            The nooks and crannies meant candles and reed diffusers were
            replaced by mouse traps and poison in each room of the house for a
            majority of the year. Forking out on rent is enough, let alone
            spending their student loan on rodent bait boxes!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sharing many rodent-like features was their landlord. Notoriously
            intimidating, the residents of this abode lived in a permanent state
            of anxiety by a landlord who alarmed and unnerved them. Even before
            their morning coffee had been poured, you couldn’t feel safe… ‘The
            landlord embarrassed one of the tenants in the street…we forgot to
            put the bins out and the landlord made a tenant run after the bin
            lorry down the street at 7 am…they didn’t even have uni that day!’
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s no surprise that these students lived in fear of their
            landlord. This is an individual who spoke down on them with ‘no
            respect or professionalism’ – a common theme from student landlords
            in our experiences. Being allocated a landlord is a bit of a
            roulette game anyway, one which these students unfortunately drew
            the short straw on.
          </p>
          <p>
            What’s more, a major leak in the shared bathroom (which, of course,
            was reported but never repaired) meant the ceiling hung in jeopardy
            over their heads and for a long while the tenants lived in constant
            fear of collapse. Even ‘after months of the landlord being aware’ in
            attempts to get the issue fixed, it meant sitting on the toilet or
            taking a long shower could never be as relaxing as it was meant to
            be.
          </p>
          <p>
            Your home is meant to be a sanctuary of escapism and comfort. It
            should take you away from all the stresses and the nasties of the
            outside world. As a result, it isn’t very settling to have
            maintenance workers stumble into your room, whilst you’re asleep and
            in very minimal clothing. At least they turned up on this occasion!
            Getting someone to fix these problems (not like they ever were
            properly fixed) was few and far between. Nine times out of ten, no
            one would even turn up to amend the reported issues and so living
            with mice and unpredictable ceilings became the norm for these
            unfortunate seven.
          </p>
          <p>
            If only there were a place, like a website or something, where you
            could publicly out these menacing landlords and ominous estate
            agents to prevent future students facing the same problem…
